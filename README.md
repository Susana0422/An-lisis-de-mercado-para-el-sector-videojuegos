- The industries that dominate the video game market are playstation and Nintendo, which statistically have equal variance and means.

- To increase sales, it is necessary to diversify the types of games by region, each country has different cultures, and therefore their preferences in games are different, advertising campaign efforts should focus on games that are having low sales for each country. Also, for the next investments in games, it should be considered that for the United States the preferred games are action, shooter and sport, for Japan, the preferred games are Role-Playing and Action and for Europe, the preferred games are: action and shooter.

- Most of the effort should be focused on getting good critic_score ratings, as this has a positive relation with respect to total sales.

- It takes about 7 years for a company to exit the video game market, although this sector is stable, the efforts to enter are complex, as this market is an oligopoly.
